# college-stuff
Basic college stuff. Anything happening in college I think can/needs to be coded, I'll end up doing it and if I'm succesful, post it here.

Contains:

1. DFA Checker [fafl.c]: Named after my course subject, Finite Automata and Formal Languages. Checks if your DFA accepts a string once you provide the 5 tuples of the DFA.
2. Matrix Inverter [MatrixInv.c]: An intermediate in my assignment for math, which is to obtain a matrix given the eigen values. I coded this from scracth because none of the programs that showed up in Google are actually working.
3. Analysis of Selection Sort [selnysis.c]: Analyzes selection sort for a large no. of values.
4. Analysis of Merge Sort [mergelysis.c]: Analyzes merge sort for a large no. of values. Tends to crash in Windows due to unchangeable stack size.
5. Matrix from Eigen Values [EigenMat.c]: Math Assigment. Gives a matrix from a set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors/
